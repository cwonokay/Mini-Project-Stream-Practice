# Mini-Project-Stream-Practice
In this Mini-Project you will be solving problems using both non-functional and functional approaches.

Streams  

Iterating and manipulating collections using for loops and streams.

We've provided an Entry JavaBean with the following variables (representing a journal entry)

Day day (an enum provided in starter files)
String note
Create a dozen Entries in a list using a "populate method" (see starter file).

Using the collection of Entry objects provided, fill in the methods in the starter files. For each method, you will need to write regular non-functional programming code, and then a functional programming solution. The first function which prints out all of the entries is given to you as an example.
